      <h1>Regulations</h1>
      <h2>Registration policy</h2>
      <p>The registration regulations will inform you on anything you need to know to be allowed to sign up as a participant for the European Tournament for Dancing Students, ETDS. Please read this document carefully, in order to make sure you know which rules apply.</p>
    </br>
      <h3>GENERAL:</h3>
      <ol start="1" id="regsListUL">
        <li id="regsList">By registering every participant declares to the ETDS committee that they agree with the registration regulations, the competition regulations and the privacy statement.</li>
        <li id="regsList">The ETDS committee reserves the right to diverge from the rules stated in the document to rule in individual cases if conflict should arise.</li>
        <li id="regsList">If a participant does not follow the conditions stated in this document, the ETDS committee reserves the right to deny this participant access to the tournament.</li>
      </ol>
    </br>
      <h3>REGISTRATION PROCEDURE:</h3>
      <ol start="4" id="regsListUL">
        <li id="regsList">Divided over the months March and April there will be 3 regular lottery rounds. Meaning there are 3 registration deadlines and 3 payment deadlines. After the third regular lottery round lotteries will take place if a participant drops out.</li>
        <li id="regsList">During a period of ten days before the next lottery round team captains will have time to register new team members in the ETDS registration system. These time periods will be announced to the team captains by the organisations.</li>
        <li id="regsList">Registration does not guarantee participation to the tournament, due to the lottery system.</li>
        <li id="regsList">The team captain is responsible for the registration of his/her team members via the by the ETDS organisation administered registration system.</li>
        <li id="regsList">Team captains register themselves as team captain in the registration system and will not have to take part in the lottery, nor do their dancing partners, with a maximum of 1 team captain with teams up to 20 participants and a maximum of 2 team captains with teams with 21 or more participants.</li>
      </ol>
    </br>
      <h3>CANCELLATIONS:</h3>
      <ol start="9" id="regsListUL">
        <li id="regsList">One week after the registration closes, the team captain will receive a final list of participants with a reserve list.</li>
        <li id="regsList">Whenever a participant cancels, his/her place will be taken by someone from the reserve list. The system will maintain the following priorities:</li>
        <ol type="a" id="regsListUL">
          <li id="regsList">The spot will be filled by a participant from the reserve list from any team, by random lottery done by the ETDS organisation. Preference will go to a participant that will stabilise the balance between lead/follow in the blind date groups of Breitensport, CloseD and Open Class.</li>
          <li id="regsList">It is not allowed to participate under someone else’s name. If done so, the participant will be disqualified and their team captain could also been disqualified if he/she allowed it.</li>
        </ol>
        <li id="regsList">The procedure mentioned in 9 will be followed on set lottery moments and, if there are cancellations, will be repeated every week in order to fill free spots. Final spots (due to cancellations) will be filled on May twenty fifth. The team captain will receive an update if a team member that was still on the reserve list got through the lottery. The final update will be on May twenty six.</li>
        <li id="regsList">If a participant on the reserve list isn’t available for the ETDS anymore they are required to let the ETDS organisation know via their team captain. The participant can be taken out of the lottery system then.</li>
      </ol>
    </br>
      <h3>FINANCIAL:</h3>
      <ol start="13" id="regsListUL">
        <li id="regsList">Within 10 days after the results of the lottery, each association has to pay the participation fees to the ETDS committee. If these are not paid within these 10 days the registered spots will be opened for the next lottery round.</li>
        <li id="regsList">If a registered member is moved from the reserve list to the participants list, their fee needs to be paid to the ETDS committee within 10 days, or else their registration will be cancelled.</li>
        <li id="regsList">If the ETDS takes place before the payment deadline is met, the participation fee needs to be paid before the start of the ETDS.</li>
        <li id="regsList">Restitution of participation fee:</li>
          <ol type="a" id="regsListUL">
            <li id="regsList">A participant will get full restitution if they cancel before April 10th 2020 and  the empty spot can be filled. Full restitution will be given to the participant’s association on July 1st latest.</li>
            <li id="regsList">A participant will receive partial restitution of the participation fee, 50%, if he/she cancels between the 10th of April and the 25th of May and the empty spot can be filled. Partial restitutions will be given latest to the participant’s association on July 1st latest.</li>
            <li id="regsList">If the empty spot cannot be filled or if a participant cancels on or after 25th of May 2020, no restitution will be given.</li>
            <li id="regsList">Associations are expected to make sure that restitutions go back to the person it belongs to. We will provide the necessary information.</li>
          </ol>
        <li id="regsList">If a participant signs up as a student, they need to bring proof of registration to the tournament. If they cannot show the required document when asked for they need to pay remaining non-student fee cash at the registration desk at the ETDS. A student card without the year 2019/2020 on it will not be accepted as proof of registration.</li>
      </ol>
    </br>
      <h3>MANDATORY TOURNAMENT SUPPORT</h3>
      <p>During the ETDS June 2020 every team is mandatory to fill volunteering shifts. More information about these volunteering shifts can be found on our website.</p>
    </br>
    </br>
      <h1>Lottery</h1>
      <p>Purpose of using a lottery system:</p>
      <ul id="regsListUL">
        <li id="regsList">The lottery system will guarantee that any team that signs up gets the possibility to represent themselves during the ETDS and, if there’s enough registrations, participate in the Maus tournament.</li>
        <li id="regsList">The lottery system takes away any stress during the registration period.</li>
        <li id="regsList">The lottery system ensures there will be less participants without a partner after blinddating. The system aims to keep the difference between lead and follow as small as possible.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>1: CONDITIONS</h2>
          </br>
      <h3>GENERAL DEMANDS</h3>
      <p>In order to have a successful tournament several demands have been made for the lottery system. Besides above mentioned purposes the following demands have been made of the lottery system, in no particular order:</p>
      <p>The lottery needs to be as fair as possible.</p>
      <p>Every team will have their team captain(s) present at the tournament. If a team has more than 20 participants 2 team captains can automatically participate, if a team has less than 20 participants only 1 team captain is assured of a spot.</p>
      <p>Couples registered together won’t be split up.</p>
      <p>By actively searching for a balanced leader/follower distribution, there is an increased chance every participant will have a partner for the competition.</p>
      <p>If a participant was excluded from a previous ETDS using the same lottery system (xTDS) at the last lottery round of that ETDS, his/her name will get a higher change within the lottery, which will increase the chance of participation.</p>
    </br>
      <h3>PARTNERS</h3>
      <p>A dancing couple that registers together will not be split up by the lottery system. Lottery will take place in pairs. If a dancer without a partner (blind dater) signs up, a lead/follow overflow might be created. In order to decrease the overflow a matching system has been developed. A Blind Dater will be matched to a “virtual partner”.</p>
      <p>This virtual partner will be the best available partner, according to dancing class, for the blind dater that signed up. A Ballroom Breitensport and latin Open/CloseD Class dancer will be matched (if possible) with someone dancing the same classes. This will make sure that as many participants as possible can find a partner during blind dating. We expect that the number of followers without a partner will decrease.</p>
    </br>
      <h3>TEAMCAPTAINS</h3>
      <p>A team needs their team captain(s), so team captains and their (virtual) partners have a guaranteed spot in the tournament. Every team can have a maximum of 2 team captains. Teams with up to 20 participants will have 1 guaranteed spot for a team captain. Teams with more than 20 participants will have 2 guaranteed spots of team captains.</p>
    </br>
      <h3>ESSENTIAL TOURNAMENT SUPPORT</h3>
      <p>To ensure there will be enough participants that can (and are willing to) fill essential shifts, lottery will initially fill up to 90% of the available participation spots. The final 10% can be used to fill essential positions by hand. The filling or not filling of these essential positions does NOT influence the chances of being selected by the lottery system. If additional tournament support isn’t necessary, then the lottery system’s random selection will proceed until the maximum number of participants has been reached.</p>
    </br>
      <h2>2: SELECTION PROCEDURE</h2>
      <p>The general selection procedure for the tournament by lottery system can be found in the image below. From all participants first the team captains and their (virtual) partners will be selected. After that the rest of the participants will be randomly selected until 90% of the maximum of participants has been reached.</p>
      <p>The remaining 10% will be selected as described in the paragraph Essential Tournament Support.</p>
      <p>The remaining registrations that have not been selected will be placed on the reserve list. Below you will find how the lottery procedure will continue, as described above, with the help of an example. The first step of the lottery system, the selecting and matching of the team captains will not be explicitly explained. The ‘matching procedure’ is the same as every other sign up without a partner.</p>
    </br>
      <h3>REMAINING PARTICIPANTS</h3>
      <p>All other registrations (Breitensport and Open/CloseD) will be placed on a list in a random order. The person on top of the list will be selected and ‘matched’.</p>
      <p>If a partner is found, both participants will be selected for the tournament and taken off of the list. The next participant on the list will be treated in the same way.</p>
      <p>If no partner is found, this person will not be selected for the tournament and the next person on the list will follow the same procedure. This will continue until 90% of the spots for the tournament have been filled. After this, it will be checked if there are enough participants who can fill the essential tournament support shifts.</p>
      <p>If the essential tournament support shifts have been filled the remaining spots will be filled in the same way as described above.</p>
    </br>
      <h3>ESSENTIAL TOURNAMENT SUPPORT</h3>
      <p>It is important to note that a participant’s willingness / possibility to be a volunteer for essential tournament support does NOT influence their chances in the lottery system. Every time a participant is chosen by the lottery system will be completely random.</p>
    </br>
      <h2>3: PARTNERS</h2>
      <p>In the previous chapter the lottery procedure concerning selecting participants was explained. The ‘matching’ of a Blind Dater to a virtual partner will be explained in this chapter.</p>
    </br>
      <h3>ASSIGNING A VIRTUAL PARTNER</h3>
      <p>When looking for a virtual partner, this system will first look for the best possible match concerning dancing class. The process will be explained with the following example:</p>
      <p>Felix signed up as a leader for Ballroom and Latin in Breitensport. He will be blind dating in both disciplines. The system has selected him to participate in the tournament. The system will look for a follower without partner dancing Breitensport Ballroom and Breitensport Latin. If there’s no follower available which meets these demands, the system will look for a follower meeting the demands of óne of the following dancing class combinations:</p>
      <ul id="regsListUL">
        <li id="regsList">Breitensport Ballroom / Open/Closed Latin</li>
      <li id="regsList">Open/Closed Ballroom / Breitensport Latin</li>
      <li id="regsList">Breitensport Ballroom / Not dancing Latin</li>
      <li id="regsList">Not dancing Ballroom / Breitensport Latin</li>
    </ul>
      <p>If a follower is found in these combinations, this means there’s a partner available for Felix in at least one of the disciplines. From this pool a random partner will be matched with Felix.</p>
      <p>Every combination of dancing classes has their own possible combinations for a partner. Enclosed you will find an overview of the combinations a participant has and to which other combinations they could be matched (besides their own combination).</p>
    </br>
      <h2>4: POSSIBLE CONFLICTS AND CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
      <p>Conflicts could occur between before mentioned demands of the lottery system:</p>
      <p>The lottery needs to be as fair as possible.</p>
      <ul id="regsListUL">
        <li id="regsList">Every team will have their team captain(s) present at the tournament. If a team has more than 20 participants 2 team captains can automatically participate, if a team has less than 20 participants only 1 team captain is assured of a spot.</li>
        <li id="regsList">Couples registered together won’t be split up.</li>
        <li id="regsList">By actively searching for a balanced leader/follower distribution, there is an increased chance every participant will have a partner for the competition.</li>
        <li id="regsList">If a participant was excluded from a previous ETDS using the same lottery system (xTDS) at the last lottery round of that ETDS, his/her name will be doubled in the pool, which will increase the chance of participation.</li>
        <li id="regsList">During the lottery procedure it could occur that the leaders with combinations Breitensport Ballroom and Breitensport latin have all been selected, meaning that followers in the same category will not have a possible partner available. This will mean that followers in other categories (Breitensport Ballroom with Open/CloseD Latin and Open/CloseD Ballroom with Breitensport Latin) won’t have any leaders available either.</li>
        <li id="regsList">The followers who cannot be matched will not be accepted into the tournament. This is a conflict between demands 1 and 4. If this scenario takes place, rule 4 will be dominant over rule 1. This means accepting that some participants have a slightly lower chance to be selected, but that the chances of finding a partner when selected is a lot higher.</li>
      </ul>
    </br>
      <h2>5: NECESSITIES FOR REGISTRATION</h2>
      <p>In order to ensure every Blind Dater can be matched to partner of the same level the following questions will be asked during registration:</p>
      <ul id="regsListUL">
        <li id="regsList">Have you ever danced competitions?</li>
        <li id="regsList">If yes, what is the highest level you have danced at?</li>
        <li id="regsList">Will you be dancing as lead or follow in Ballroom and/or Latin?</li>
        <li id="regsList">Who is your partner in Ballroom and/or Latin – name / blinddate</li>
    </ul>
    </br>

    </br>
      <h3>GENERAL:</h3>
      <p>The ETDS is a recurring dancing tournament for students, organised by the ETDS committee. This time in the name of Stichting ETDS Amsterdam 2020.
      The ETDS committee reserves the right to diverge from the rules stated in this document to rule in individual cases if conflict should arise.
      If a situation arises to which the rules stated in this document do not (sufficiently) apply, the ETDS committee will decide on the matter.</p>
    </br>
      <h3>PARTICIPATION:</h3>
      <p>Every student can participate in the ETDS, if this student is associated with a student dancing association by means of a membership of some sort.</p>
      <p>Participation to the ETDS by a non-student (from hereon external) is only possible if this person is associated with a student dancing association by means of a membership of some sort.</p>
      <p>The ETDS has 2 classes: Breitensport and CloseD/Open.</p>
      <p>Participants in the Breitensport will dance a qualification round based on which they will be divided into 4 subclasses: Amateurs, Professionals, Masters and Champions.</p>
      <p>Participants in CloseD/Open class will dance a qualification round which will decide whether they will dance CloseD or Open class.</p>
      <p>If the adjudicators notice during the first round that a couple’s level is too high for that class, it can be decided to move the couple to a higher class.</p>
      <p>Competition dancers will not be allowed to dance Breitensport with their own dancing partner if they dance competitions in or have danced competitions in the following classes:</p>
      <ol type="a" id="regsListUL">
        <li id="regsList">NADB: Debutants 2</li>
        <li id="regsList">NDO: National amateurs</li>
        <li id="regsList">WDC: National amateurs until B poule</li>
        <li id="regsList">NVAD: Debutants 1</li>

        <li id="regsList">Tsjech Republic: D-class</li>

        <li id="regsList">Tsjech Republic: D-class, C-class</li>
        <li id="regsList"> United Kingdom: Intermediate, Advanced</li>
      </ol>
